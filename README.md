# The Weather.Zone App

Site URL: https://weather-app-nextjs13.vercel.app/

## Description:
I started this project as I wanted to expand my knowledge about using APIs and NextJS 13. This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data of different cities or countries. When it fails to fetch data, a toast will appear indicating that it failed to fetch the data or that country/city is not found.

## Tools I used:
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- react-icons
- framer-motion
- react-toastify
- axios
